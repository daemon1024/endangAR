# EndangAR

Animals all around are being hunted and consumed to satisfy the wants of humans. And while not necessary, it’s being done a lot. A lot of animals have been completely wiped out due to the damage caused by us humans, and we don’t even realise or acknowledge it. We wanted to spread and create more empathy and knowledge towards the environment and wildlife out there.


Our Project shows you a lot of animals and plants in danger on a map of the entire planet as pins. You can then get more information about them by tapping/clicking on pins and then you can even render a 3D model and watch it more closely in your surroundings with AR.
